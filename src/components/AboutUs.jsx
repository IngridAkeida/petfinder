          We know pet adoption, because we're adopters too. We think it's just
          about the best thing you can do. But we'll be real: it can be a
          lengthy (paperwork-filled) process.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[30rem]">
          So we're making it easier, with the tools, advice, and transparency
          you needâ€”from the first search through to daily life as a pet parent.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[30rem]">
          Because we'll do whatever it takes to help millions of people and pets
          find each other.
